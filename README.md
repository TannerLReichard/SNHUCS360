# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The requirements and goals of the app was to create a inventory management app for mobile phones that allows the users, with a target audience of small-to-medium sized businesses to add, adjust, and delete inventory quantities for their business, and when inventory is low or depleted, to send out SMS messages to alert people to restock. 

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The screens and features needed included a log in screen, which would allow the users to log into their account and see what inventory was tied with their ID, which also included a register button that would allow new users to sign up. After logging in, users would see a grid view that would give them their items include name, quantity, and the option to delete and add new items to their list. An option on the screen was the SMS notification feature, which would allow users to select and then show them  a confirmation prompt to allow or decline SMS notifications to be sent with their phone. The UI was minimalistic, with the intetnion to not bog down employees who are on the warehouse floor with unecessary features. It was intended to take minimal clicks to get into and immediately start adjusting inventory, making it quick and easy for users to use the app.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
Coding was intended to have each activity be taken separately to make orginization and further modification clean to do. Due to personal circumstances, unfortunately I only got part of the log in script done, however the intention was to have separate database tables with SQLite with a primary and foreign key of the user accounts to populate once the user was logged in, with the grid view page populating data from the inventory table based on the ID.

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I repeatedly tested what I got done to ensure it was working while I attempted to work on the rest to ensure further additions didn't break what was already finished. It's very important to keep the jenga tower of your code from toppling what's already there, which did come in handy multiple times when I tried adding some things that ended up breaking the log in button. 

# Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
As far as innovation goes, being able to get the log in database to work after referencing the book and some documentation and videos was a miracle in and of it self as burnt out and exhausted as I am. If I had just a bit more time I could have at least gotten the database for the inventory itself working, but I'm really at my limit here.

# In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
While in hindsight I needed to add more functinality buttons to the UI, I think the overall design of it and the layout was very cute and would definitely make for a fine app with everything working the way it should. I think after this course and the research I did during it, if I need to design another app's UI and implement it into XML I could make something pretty impressive.
